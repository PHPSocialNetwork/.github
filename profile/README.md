### Welcome to Phpfastcache organization ðŸŒŸ

It is called `PHPSocialNetwork` for historic reasons and can't be changed easily, but this organization is the home of where Phpfastcache and its extensions are growing !

Make sure to take a look at the famous [Phpfastcache](https://github.com/PHPSocialNetwork/phpfastcache) library as well and [its extensions](https://github.com/PHPSocialNetwork?q=-extension&type=all&language=&sort=#org-profile-repositories).

Over the years I did my best to provide a strong a reliable library that help a lot of people engaged in caching implementations.
